# Financial Statement Sentiment Analysis Using BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa

This project compares the use of three language models (BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa) for sentiment analysis of statements related to financial markets. Each model was fine-tuned using financial statements that were hand-annotated by financial experts. Statements were classified as either positive, negative or neutral. Following fine-tuning, each model was evaluated on a test set of data.
